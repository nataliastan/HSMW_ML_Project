# HSMW_ML_Project
Machine Learning Project: GMM, SNPC

Tasks

Part 1:

Determine a reasonable number of clusters inside the data. Decide for your own which measure you will choose to evaluate this reasonable number.
Fit a GMM model with the data and choose the number of components regarding your outcome of the 1st task.

Part 2:

You should implement the algorithm assigned to you (SNPC) and train it on the given training data. Try to find an optimal number of prototypes using cross validation.
There is another set of data which is unlabeled. You have to classify it with your trained result.
